Kuronometer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pedrovgs/Kuronometer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pedrovgs/Kuronometer)
===========

Kuronometer is a [Gradle Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html) developed using purely functional programming in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). Using this Gradle plugin you can see how long you've been compiling your project during the last day or since the last clean execution using just one command:

**After configuring this plugin execute any build from Android Studio or your terminal:**

```
./gradlew assemble
```

Then check the build time gathered using the following commands:

```
./gradlew totalBuildTime
```

or

```
./gradlew todayBuildTime
```

Additionally, Kuronometer is going to report your build time to a remote service we will use to show how long developers around the world have been building software. Soon, we will publish a real time chronometer with the amount of time we've been building software [here](http://kuronometer.io). Your project data can be reported anonymously, so don't be afraid of using this project. Server side code can be found [here](https://github.com/delr3ves/KuronometerServer).

## Installation

Apply the plugin in your ``build.gradle``:

```groovy

buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.github.pedrovgs:kuronometer:0.0.5'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.github.pedrovgs.kuronometer'

```

## Configuration

You just need to indicate the project platform being used:

```groovy
...
apply plugin: 'com.github.pedrovgs.kuronometer'

kuronometer {
    platformName = 'Android' //This value can be Android, Java or Scala
}
```

If you need any advanced configuration:

```groovy

kuronometer {
    //Config used to indicate the platform or language name. By default the value configured is Java.
    platformName = 'Android'
    //Config used to attach or not sensitive information before to being reported. By default is true.
    //This value can be true or false.
    reportProjectInfo = true
    //Config used to send or not the build report to the kuronometer server. By default is true.
    //This value can be true or false.
    reportDataRemotely = true
    //Config used to show a message after the build execution showing the report execution result. By default is false.
    //This value can be true or false.
    verbose = true
}
```

Inside the [kuronometer-consumer](./kuronometer-consumer/build.gradle) and the [kuronometer-android-consumer](./kuronometer-android-consumer/app/build.gradle) folders you can find two configuration examples.

## Build and test this project

To build this and runt the unit and integration tests execute ``./gradlew build``.

## Run this project

To install this plugin in a local repository and test it from any consumer execute these commands:

```
./gradlew install
cd kuronometer-consumer
./gradlew build
```

## Release a new version

Before to release a new kuronometer version remember to update the config build files:

```
gradle.properties
kuronometer-android-consumer/build.gradle
kuronometer-consumer/build.gradle
kuronometer-core/build.gradle
kuronometer/build.gradle
```

Then execute ``./gradlew clean build uploadArchives``. Remember to configure your ``~/.gradle/gradle.properties`` file.
